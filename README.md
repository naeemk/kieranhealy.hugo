# naeemk.hugo

This is the code and much of the content for my website, http://XYZ.no. As detailed [in this post](http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2014/02/24/powered-by-hugo/) the site is created using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a very fast static site generator written by Steve Francia. The present version uses the [Kube CSS framework](http://imperavi.com/kube/), takes advantage of a site design by [Greg Restall](http://consequently.org), and requires Hugo version 0.15 or higher.
